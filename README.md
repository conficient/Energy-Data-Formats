# EnergyCommissionFormat
This repository documents the file format for broker commission for energy suppliers in the UK

## Background

We are a UK Energy Broker and receive commission from energy providers for customers we've signed up. Our biggest
monthy issue is the reading the commission files each month from the suppliers. Some use Excel files. Some use CSV.
Almost all of them change the format of the data from time to time, and some are created manually each month.
